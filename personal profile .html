<h1 style="color:red;">Hobbies</h1>
<p>My hobby is playing chess and playing video games i love to play chess so much because it is very interesting .Chess is a board game for two players. It is played on a square board, made up of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares in each row and column. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. I left chess before 3 years because of this pandemic covid-19  beacuse of this no coaches came to teach me . I was the top 5th best player in India before  three years .  <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/45075093">Yuvan kartik chess player . </a></p>
